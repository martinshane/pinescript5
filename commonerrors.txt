The if statement is too long
This error occurs when the indented code inside an if statement is too large for the compiler. Because of how the compiler works, you won’t receive a message telling you exactly how many lines of code you are over the limit. The only solution now is to break up your if statement into smaller parts (functions or smaller if statements). The example below shows a reasonably lengthy if statement; theoretically, this would throw line 4: if statement is too long.
